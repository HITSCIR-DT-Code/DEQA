# DEQA:What did you refer to? Evaluating Co-references in Dialogue

we create a large scale benchmark, open domain Dialogue Entity via Question Answering (DEQA), which consists of one English dataset and one Chinese dataset, of 8,415 and 6,203 dialogues, respectively.

**NOTE** We are applying to Douban for permission to redistribute the data. We will publish the data as soon as possible after obtaining the permission of Douban.
